With direction, I came to study at NZIS to learn how to develop my body in strength and conditioning, muscle hypertrophy, weight loss and gain. With GOD helping me along my journey and providing me with the right people/support, I have seen many great benefits to what having a teacher can do for you and find it a privilege and joy to help build others also, guiding them on how to achieve their novice to amateur careers safely without making the same mistakes to their body as everyone else.",
